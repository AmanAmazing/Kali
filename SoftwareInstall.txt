#Using apt (Advanced Packaging Tool) to handle software 
#main tool is 'apt-get'

'apt-cache search packagename' | checks if software is already installed 
'apt-get install packagename'  | installs the package

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Deleting software
'apt-get remove packagename'   | deletes the software
#if you want to remove the configuration files aswell
'apt-get purge packagename' | removes configuration files aswell 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#updating software
'apt-get update' | checks if updates are available 
'apt-get upgrade'| updates those packages

#Adding Repositories to your sources.list file 

The servers that hold the software for particular distributions of Linux
are known as repositories. Nearly every distribution has its own
repositories of software—developed and configured for that distribution
—that might not work well, or at all, with other distributions. Although
these repositories often contain the same or similar software, they aren’t
identical, and they sometimes have different versions of the same
software or entirely different software.
You will, of course, be using the Kali repository, which has a large
amount of security and hacking software. But because Kali specializes in
security and hacking, it doesn’t include some specialty software and
tools and even some run-of-the-mill software. It’s worth adding a
backup repository or two that your system can search through in case it
doesn’t find it a specific software in the Kali repository.
The repositories your system will search for software are stored in
the sources.list file, and you can alter this file to define from which
repositories you want to download software. I often add the Ubuntu
repositories after the Kali repositories in my sources.list file; that way,
when I request to download a new software package, my system will
first look in the Kali repository, and if the software package isn’t there, it
will look in the Ubuntu repository.
You can find the sources.list file at /etc/apt/sources.list and open it with
any text editor.
